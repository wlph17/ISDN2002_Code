Introduction
=================
The MetaWear Python API provides a simple way to communicate with your MetaWear boards using Apple devices.  

This is a thin wrapper around the `MetaWear C++ API <https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-Cpp>`_ so you will find the `C++ documentation <https://mbientlab.com/cppdocs/latest/>`_ and `API reference <https://mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/cpp/latest/globals.html>`_ useful.

This guide assumes you have fundamental knowledge of Python programming.
